    <p>When faced with vast sets of data in forms our eyes and ears cannot readily interpret, we forgo the abilities we depend on to learn about the world. One of my goals is to develop new senses: using data science and machine learning to turn numbers into new knowledge and building a statistical intuition.</p>
   	<p>Practically speaking, this means I look at datasets and try things. </p>

	<h3>Trolley Problem in VR - Spring 2015</h3>
	<p>You don the headset, and walk across the station. Something is wrong, and people are tied to the tracks: five on the main track and one on the other. There's a lever in the center. You hear a train. Do you pull the lever? When the train arrives, you're not done. The game starts again, but you're in the body of one of the people tied to the tracks. Most likely, you are one of the five.</p>
	<p>I implemented this using Unreal Engine 4 for Occulus Rift.</p>

	<h3>Recursive stick art - Fall 2014</h3>
	<img src="graphicsMontage.jpg" style="max-width:800px; width:80%; display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p>These were created through a recursive algorithm, but intuitively. Imagine a chain of popsicle sticks, each attached to the next by a shaft with a rotor and pen attached. We get the rotation speed using an equation f(n) where n is the rotor in question.</p>
    <p> Given an equation, you can watch the sticks carve out patterns. </p>
